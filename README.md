# Sonar-Detection-Motor-Circuit
This was a final project for my Engineering Design and Manufacturing class for sophomore year that powers a motor forward or backward depending on how close an object is to the sonar detector. The Circuit features the use of an arduino, integrated circuit, piezo buzzer, potentiometer, sonar detector, and motor.

If there is no object close to the sonar detector, the motor will spin forwards but if there an obstruction close to the sonar detector, the motor will spin the opposite way, reversing away from the obstacle while the buzzer starts beeping. The motor will then halt until the obstruction is moved and the buzzer will beep at a lesser frequency.
